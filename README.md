# Email-Preprocessing: Distinguishing Spam Emails from Real Emails

Implements an email spam filter to determine whether an email is spam or real. In doing this, compare the performance of K Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes by creating these classifiers, training them on email data, then using these models to predict whether any email is spam. For the training, used the Enron spam email dataset of about 34,000 emails and converted them to numeric features.
