Skewness, the k didn't matter much; no matter what, the accuracy was very high at around 0.95. I found this value was most consistently high when I used a k of 10, however. Since this accuracy is very high, it shows that these two features very definitively affect whether or not a banknote is determined to be authentic or not. \n",

    "I decided to compare the other features in the dataset: as X, I tried kurtosis of image (kind of a measure of resolution/noise of an image, in that a higher kurtosis level corresponds to higher noise and resolution of an image). As Y, I tried entropy of image (measures the randomness of each pixel in an image). For this one, a higher k, such as 20, affected the accuracy by moving it down about 0.1, so settled on k=7 as the most accurate one, yielding about 0.75 every time I ran the classification. This is less accurate than the two other features, so I would say that kurtosis and entropy contribute less definitively to the classification of banknotes as authentic or not.\n",

I added a new boolean parameter to the top_words method, which defaults to False, but when set to true, filters out the stop words in the output for top words. I then found the Naive Bayes accuracy when run with top words with a false no_stop_words paramater, then compared it to a true no_stop_words parameter. I compared them by going through the whole test twice then comparing the accuracy of the naive_bayes_classifier for each; the accuracy for the no-stop-words was slightly lower, but definitely much more similar to the original accuracy than I thought it would be; I removed the most common words, after all. This is probably because these words appear in both spam and ham so often that they cancel each other out. "

    "The method in KNN that predicts the classes of the test values is also the one where you need to compute the distance to each of the k neighbors of each point, then see which class the most of them are in. When I originally implemented this method last week, I just used Euclidian distance because I thought it would be the most accurate. However, I decided to try another distance metric to see if it would make more sense; unfortunately, since I did not know what L1 distance was, I had to look it up. This is \"Manhattan Cityblock\" distance, which means it measures the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors in the x direction and y direction, since in Manhattan you can't cut across blocks and make diagonal shortcuts, as you can in L2 distance metrics. I implemented a new predict method, predict_cityblock, which calculates manhattan distance, then compared the accuracies of using both predict/distance methods. As I thought, the accuracy for L2 distance was 0.88 and the accuracy for L1 distance was 0.25, most likely because the distance should probably be measured radially (in one straight, direct line) to be more accurate.
